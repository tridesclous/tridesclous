"""
This is a demo of tridesclous online.
It is based on pyacq framework.

In pyacq:
  * Manager is the big chief
  * Nodegroup is a process running somewhere on a PC (here on the same machine)
  * Node is an infinite loop for processing or a viewer

in tridesclous.online there are sevreal Nodes:
  * OnlinePeeler: this the peeler but for online data
  * OnlineTraceViewer: this is a viewer for dilplay processed signal and sorted spikes
  * OnlineWindow: some kind of integrated OnlinePeeler+OnlineTraceViewer with some action to
     construct the catalogue on the fly.


Here a demo.
